👋 Hey there! I'm Caio, a passionate Technical Assistant at Instituto de Pesquisas Eldorado, where I specialize in developing and maintaining PL/SQL routines and reports for the Accounts Payable and General Ledger modules of Oracle EBS. With over 3 years of experience, I'm deeply involved in bug detection, software analysis, and product development using the SCRUM framework.

🎓 Currently pursuing a graduate degree in Software Engineering at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, I'm committed to staying at the forefront of industry trends and technologies. As part of my continuous growth, I'm also dedicating myself to enhancing my skills as a Java SpringBoot developer.
